# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Multilingual Quantitative Biologist Organization!

There are several repositiories here for different components of this project, from the core materials (the source of the [online book](https://mulquabio.github.io/MQB/intro.html)), to assessment tools (mostly experimental at present) and solutions.

If in doubt about where to start, or which one to contribute to, in most likelihood you are looking for the main [MQB book repo](https://github.com/MulQuaBio/MQB). 

You may also want to take a peek at this org's [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/MulQuaBio/discussions).
