Hello! 

This is a special-purpose repository to centralize and manage default settings, templates, and configuration files for all repositories under the MulaWuaBio organization, to manage and enforce MQB  organization standards efficiently.

Here's a breakdown of its main purposes:

### 1. **Profile Page for the Organization**
The [`profile/README.md`](https://github.com/MulQuaBio/.github/tree/main/profile) file here serves as the organization-level README, appearing on the [main page of the organization](https://github.com/mulquabio) to provide an overview and introduction to this organization and its projects.

### 2. **Default Community Health Files**
Files like `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `SUPPORT.md` can (or will eventually be) be found here, and will be the defaults for all repositories within this organization. This is to promote consistency across projects without needing to duplicate these files in each repository.

### 3. **Organization-wide Issue and Pull Request Templates**
 This repository includes custom templates for issues and pull requests that can be applied across the organization (e.g., `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` for multiple issue templates, and  `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` for a single pull request template to standardize the process of submitting issues and pull requests.

### 4. **Centralized Workflow Configuration**
Reusable GitHub Actions workflows will be stored under `.github/workflows/`, which can be referenced across other repositories, enabling easier maintenance and consistent continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery/deployment (CD) pipelines across the multiple MQB projects to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes, ensuring reliability and repeatability across all repositories.

### 5. **Default Issue Labels**

The `.github/labels.yml` file defines default issue labels to  repositories, ensuring uniform issue categorization across all projects.
